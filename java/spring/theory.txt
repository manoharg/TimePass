Dependency injection / Dependency inversion:
separation of concerns


Servlet:
When a client sends a request to a page, the web container(tomcat, glassfish, jboss) on the server will look in the web.xml (deployment descriptor) and will serve the page.
In spring, Dispatcher servlet does this work,all requests will be forwarded to dispatcher servlet.
Code:
<servlet>
	<name>
	<class>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
	<name>
	</url>
</servlet-mapping>

Calling a servlet from another:
RequestDispatcher or Redirect:
One servlet can call other servlet using requestDispatcher, and session can be used to retrieve attributes. You can also set in httpRequest (setAttribute)
In RequestDispatcher , client will not know from where the response is getting.
In redirecting, client will be redirected (Payment gateway)
